# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/espretto/garagiste/1.0.0/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/espretto/garagiste/1.0.0/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```

## Database Management

To [re]create the sqlite database issue the following command from the project root:
```sh
python -m database
```

## Troublshooting

### Faulty dependencies
Upon launching the server `python -m swagger_server` you get the following warning:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'FileStorage'
```
The fix is already under way in package `connexion@1.1.16`. Quick fix it in python's `lib/site-packages/connexion/decorators/validation.py` with the following
```diff
- from werkzeug import FileStorage
+ from werkzeug.datastructures import FileStorage
```

### Enforce Foreign Keys
Sqlite does not enforce foreign keys by default. The setting can be changed using the following command:
```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```
However, the sqlite installation needs to have been compiled with certain flags (see the [docs](https://sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html)) for the setting to persist and take effect. To circumvent this shortcoming, the above command can be issued with every new connection.
